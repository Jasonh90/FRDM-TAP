# FReeDoM Tap

> Inspired by [TFT Board Connection through SPI to FRDM](https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=357447003) && [DDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv7gxqEhcBo).

#### The final project can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNjPBQOvEKo)

> This was completely build and developed from scratch using an OLED, wired connections, and hardware programming that involved interrupts, and other Embedded System concepts.
